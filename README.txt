= Commander

== DESCRIPTION:

Commander combines the execution of system commands and logging.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Supports single or batched commands
* Provides exit status after command is run.
* Extends logger to capture output from STDOUT or STDERR, and flag errors

Commander uses the open4 gem and the ruby logger to accomplish these tasks.

== SYNOPSIS:

Commander was intended for use in rake tasks which launched multiple system commands. Program flow had to be varied based on the exit status or source of the output from these commands, so Commander includes some convenience methods which encapsulate the logic needed for that purpose.

  log = Logger.new( STDOUT )
  log.level = Logger::Warn 
  c = Commander.new( log )

Commander accepts single commands:

  c = Commander.new( log )
  c.run( "df -h" )

Alternatively, you may add commands to an array for batch execution:

  c = Commander.new( log )
  c.commands << "df -h"
  c.commands << "ls -ltrh"
  c.run_commands()

Exit status of a single command is trivial to check:

  c = Commander.new( log )
  c.run( "df -h" )
  p c.exit_status #=> 0

Because Commander is tied to the ruby logger, you may easily check for error messages:

  c = Commander.new( log )
  c.run( "df -h" )
  p c.errors? #=> false

=Note

Please note: You must initialize Commander with a reference to a Logger object. Additionally, Commander requires the {Open4}[http://www.codeforpeople.com/lib/ruby/open4/] gem (by Ara T. Howard).
